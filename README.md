# Principles-of-Programming
Python Coursework (Franklin University)

Course Description
This course covers fundamental programming principles for individuals with at least some
programming background. Major themes are structured programming, problem solving, algorithm
design, and software lifecycle. Topics will include testing, data types, operators, repetition and
selection control structures, functions and procedures, arrays, and objects. Students will design,
code, test, debug, and document programs in a relevant programming language.

Prerequisites
College Algebra (MATH 160)
Problem Solving with Computing (COMP 101)

Course Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the stages of the software lifecycle.
2. Design solutions using top-down stepwise refinement.
3. Translate algorithms into clearly documented and modularized programming language code.
4. Generate and execute industry accepted test plans.
5. Use sound object oriented design principles to implement linear data structures.
6. Apply recursion to solve applicable problems.
7. Analyze the efficiency of algorithms.
8. Describe and implement well-known searching and sorting algorithms.

Pre-Course Reading and Preparation
In order to prepare you for success in ITEC136, youâ€™ve been assigned prework: a reading
assignment and videos to watch before the first week of class. Please make sure to complete the
reading and watch the videos before the first day of the course. There will be a quiz over this
material.
